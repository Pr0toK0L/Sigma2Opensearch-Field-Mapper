    If this activity is related to new benign software installation activity,
    consider adding exceptions â€” preferably with a combination of user and
    command line conditions.
  - >-
    If this activity is related to a system administrator or developer who uses
    port tunneling/forwarding for benign purposes, consider adding exceptions
    for specific user accounts or hosts. 
  - >-
    Try to understand the context of the execution by thinking about the user,
    machine, or business purpose. A small number of endpoints, such as servers
    with unique software, might appear unusual but satisfy a specific business
    need.
